# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes the global spread of COVID-19 using data from multiple sources. The goal is to visualize trends, perform country-specific analyses, and explore correlations between different variables.

## Data Sources
- **COVID-19 Data**: [COVID-19 Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/covid-19/main/data/countries-aggregated.csv)
- **Testing Data**: [Testing Data](https://example.com/your-testing-data.csv)
- **Continent Data**: [Continent Information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbouquin/IS_608/master/NanosatDB_munging/Countries-Continents.csv)

## Project Tasks
1. **Load and Pre-process the Dataset**
   - Load data using Pandas.
   - Handle missing values and convert date columns to `datetime` format.

2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
   - Inspect the dataset for basic information and outliers.
   - Clean and prepare the data for analysis.

3. **Visualize Global Trends**
   - Plot confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
   - Use line plots for visualizations.

4. **Country-Specific Analysis**
   - Visualize trends for specific countries.
   - Compare trends across multiple countries.

5. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Create bar plots to compare confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
   - Analyze growth rates using moving averages.

6. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Explore correlations between confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
   - Visualize using heatmaps.

## Usage
Run the analysis in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment. Ensure that all dependencies are installed, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the global spread of COVID-19, the effectiveness of testing and lockdown measures, and the impact across different continents.
